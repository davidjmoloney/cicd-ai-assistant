## Changes
### `ria/services/search_service.py` (confidence: 95%)
**Reasoning:** The lambda function returns x["percentage"] which is a float (from the float() conversion above). MyPy needs explicit type annotation to understand this returns a comparable type.
- **replace** (line 98): The lambda function returns x["percentage"] which is a float (from the float() conversion above). MyPy needs explicit type annotation to understand this returns a comparable type.

### `ria/views.py` (confidence: 95%)
**Reasoning:** Added type annotations for the dictionary variables that count activities by type and user. Both are string-to-int mappings based on the usage pattern.
